# PyTorch with CUDA support for Jetson
# NOTE: PyTorch should be installed from Jetson AI Lab PyPI for CUDA compatibility:
#   pip install torch==2.8.0 torchvision==0.23.0 --index-url=https://pypi.jetson-ai-lab.io/jp6/cu126
#
# This provides matched torch/torchvision wheels built for JetPack 6.x with CUDA 12.6

# TensorRT optimization (optional, for production)
# tensorrt>=8.6.0
